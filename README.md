This bot was made to notify users on telegram when they can go to face-to-face lessons.

For example, if your university ID number is even, you can go to lessons physically only if the week number is even.

## Installation
You can grab a release and start it, or build it yourself with `go build`.

Remember to configure the bot (see `example_config.yml`)
